{"name":"Rymate Browser","tagline":"Webkit based browser writen in C#","body":"## What is this?\r\nThe Rymate Browser is a lightweight WebKit based browser written in C#. It is currently in developement, and when completed should have a few of these features:\r\n* Bookmarks\r\n* History\r\n* A New Tab Page\r\n* Webapps\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome at our GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n## Why Webkit?\r\nWebkit is in my opinion one of the most compatible web browser engines out there. It is also one of the most popular, powering Safari, Chrome, the iOS Browser and the Android Browser. Its also much better than the default C# WebBrowser control in terms of web standards compliance.\r\n\r\n## How do I contribute to it?\r\nAll you need to do is checkout the git repository and start coding! You will need the [Awesomium Web Browser Framework](http://awesomium.com/) in order to compile it.\r\n### Preferred Coding Style\r\nComments and the default C# coding style please. I don't care about tabs/spaces, just make sure it all lines up.\r\n\r\n## I found a Bug!\r\nReport the bug at the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n## I have a feature request!\r\nSuggest it at the GitHub repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
